**DCC++EX provides a low cost flexible solution using readily available microprocessors to create a  Digital Command & Control (DCC) Command Station to control a model railroad. DCC++EX users fall into three main roles.  The roles are organized based on what a user wants to do with DCC++EX. Don't worry, the roles are integrated and you can switch to another role whenever you want. See which of the following DCC++EX roles you best identify with.**

### Engineer (or Operator) (hat logo?)- is for the DCC++EX user who just wants to run trains. 
You could be someone new to the hobby or someone picking up the hobby up again after a long absence; or you maybe a model railroader who is currently running a DC model railroad system and is looking to inexpensively switch over to a DCC system. DCC++EX provides you with a low cost "out of the box" working solution that gives you a Command Station and a Controller which you can setup and get running in just a few minutes. 

As an DCC++EX Engineer,you just want to drive trains and don't want to have to deal with the details of the hardware or software involved. This role keeps  things simple.  This is the perfect place for someone who just wants wants to have a holiday set or to spend time enjoying a model railroad with a child.

**Note - probably want to put this in the Engineering Role** Once you are running your DCC++EX model railroad, you may want to do more just run your trains in a loop.  When you are ready, you can  learn about the Java Model RailRoad Interface (JMRI). JMRI is another application that allows you to control additional features of your model railroad.

### Tinkerer (or Maker) (gear logo?)- likes the joy of putting things together themselves and learning how things work. 
Tinkerers should be willing to follow instructions to place jumper wires on pins or use a soldering iron.  Although they are not software experts they should be willing to open a file and a change settings in the software and upload it back to their microprocessor controlled Command Station. 

The Tinkerer Role covers more options than the Engineer Role.  If you want more power, want to control turnouts, sensors or other accessories this may be the role you you.

### Developer (brain logo?)- is for those of you who wants to help maintain and Extend DCC++EX. 
Deveopers have a desire to dig a deeper into how things work. They either  understand the basics of programming or want to learn how to program. As a Developer you will need to look at source code and make changes to the source.  This role provides detailed technical information and covers in depth topics such as accessory control, customizing systems to add unique features or hardware. It also provides for easy communication with other DCC++EX developers. 

Developers will need to use GitHub and are not averse to experimenting with things like using a different motor board, following a schematic or soldering a transistor or two to make something work.
