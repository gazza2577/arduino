Thanks for considering contributing to our project. Here is a guide for how to get started and and a list of our conventions. We will also walk you through the Github command line and Desktop commands necessary to download the code, make changes, and get it included in a next version of the sofware.

## Development Platform

We are using Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO. To get everything you need, follow these steps:

* Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE
* Download and install the latest version of Visual Studio Code from Microsoft
* Run VSCode and click on the "extensions" icon on the left. Install "PlatformIO IDE for VSCode" and the "Arduino Framework" support

If you don't see C/C++ Installed in the list, install that too. We also recomment installing the Gitlens extension to make working with Git and GitHub even easier.

You may ask if you can use the Arduino IDE, Visual Studio, or even a text editor and the answer is "of course" if you know what you are doing. Since you are just changing text files, you can use whatever you like as long as your commits and pull requests can be merged in GitHub.

## Code Formatting

We are using the "Visual Studio" C++ code formatting standard. Make sure in your VSCode Settings that the C_Cpp:Clang_format_fallback Style is set to "Visual Studio". Then when you right click and select "Format Document" (or use the Alt-Shift-F shortcut) your code will be standardized to the DCC++ EX style.
