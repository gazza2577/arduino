    -   [x] Entering loco name as "loco #3" results in "loco 33" being registered.
    -   [x] Delete of roster entry doesn't always force refresh of section.
-   [x] WiFi Management:
    -   [x] Migrated to OpenMRN Esp32WiFiManager.
    -   [x] Integrate the WiFiConfiguration CDI element to CS CDI.
    -   [x] Add fallback option for Esp32WiFiManager to not reboot the node when SSID connect fails and SoftAP is active.
